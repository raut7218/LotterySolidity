Simple Lottery Smart Contract
This is a simple lottery smart contract that allows users to buy tickets and randomly select a winner.

Functions
buyTicket() allows users to buy tickets for the lottery.
getWinner() returns the address of the winner of the lottery.
random() generates a random number that is used to select the winner of the lottery.
selectWinner() selects the winner of the lottery and assigns the winnings to their address.
How to deploy
To deploy this contract, you can use a tool like Remix or Truffle. Once the contract is deployed, users can buy tickets by sending ether to the contract address. The winner of the lottery is randomly selected and the winnings are transferred to their address.

Example
Here is an example of how to buy a ticket and check the winner:

// Buy a ticket
contract Lottery = new Lottery(0.01 ether);

// Check the winner
uint256 winner = Lottery.getWinner();

Security considerations
This contract is a simple example and does not take into account all of the security considerations that are necessary for a real-world lottery. For example, the random number generator could be biased, and the contract could be vulnerable to attacks such as front-running
